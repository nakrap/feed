Never worry about what to eat for the entire week again! The concept behind this application is to help families come to a consensus on what to eat for the week.  

## How the application works
The application asks the user to create account or login in if the user already has an account. The user then inputs a list of meal preferences for the week. The user may also choose from a pre-made list of meal preferences and add it to their meal preferences. From there the user would click generate and the application randomly picks meals from the database and populates a 7 day meal list.
